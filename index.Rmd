# The need for ‘filler’ text

Hello! Publishers, designers, and others have since the early days of printing have often found themselves in the need of text that had the look and feel of the text used in production, but at the sametime would stand out and not mistaken for such text. 

The first version of this is the famous _Lorem ipsum_, but the internet now has many other variations. This mini book has sample text from some of these variations.

# Trump _ipsum_

Lorem Ipsum's father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot. We are going to make placeholder text great again. Greater than ever before. An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that Lorem Ipsum's birth certificate is a fraud.

If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it. I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words. Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with other websites.

Be careful, or I will spill the beans on your placeholder text. Lorem Ipsum better hope that there are no "tapes" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it.

The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics! That other text? Sadly, it’s no longer a 10. You're telling the enemy exactly what you're going to do. No wonder you've been fighting Lorem Ipsum your entire adult life.

I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable. You're telling the enemy exactly what you're going to do. No wonder you've been fighting Lorem Ipsum your entire adult life.

# Postmodern _ipsum_

[https://www.elsewhere.org/pomo/](https://www.elsewhere.org/pomo/)

“Reality is fundamentally used in the service of class divisions,” says
Foucault. The subject is interpolated into a cultural narrative that includes
narrativity as a whole.

The primary theme of the works of Stone is the role of the artist as writer.
However, Sontag uses the term ‘objectivism’ to denote not constructivism as
such, but subconstructivism. The subject is contextualised into a predialectic
theory that includes sexuality as a paradox.

If one examines cultural narrative, one is faced with a choice: either
reject premodern discourse or conclude that discourse must come from
communication. Thus, the failure, and thus the dialectic, of objectivism which
is a central theme of Stone’s Heaven and Earth emerges again in
Natural Born Killers, although in a more mythopoetical sense. Prinn[1] implies that we have to choose between cultural capitalism
and neodialectic material theory.

“Class is responsible for the status quo,” says Foucault. But Lacan suggests
the use of cultural narrative to attack and modify society. The main theme of
Tilton’s[2] analysis of predialectic theory is the paradigm
of conceptualist class.

Thus, in Models, Inc., Spelling reiterates neotextual discourse; in
Robin’s Hoods, however, he examines objectivism. Lyotard uses the term
‘cultural narrative’ to denote a patriarchial totality.

In a sense, the example of objectivism intrinsic to Spelling’s Beverly
Hills 90210 is also evident in The Heights. The subject is
interpolated into a predialectic theory that includes narrativity as a whole.

It could be said that Baudrillard promotes the use of cultural narrative to
challenge class divisions. The subject is contextualised into a predialectic
theory that includes consciousness as a paradox.

But Lyotard’s model of objectivism states that reality is capable of truth,
given that the premise of predialectic theory is invalid. The subject is
interpolated into a cultural narrative that includes art as a whole.

It could be said that if pretextual objectivism holds, we have to choose
between predialectic theory and semantic subcultural theory. Debord uses the
term ‘Derridaist reading’ to denote not, in fact, narrative, but neonarrative. 

# Fillerama _ipsum_

Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that.

Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Hello Morbo, how's the family? Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk!

Is that a cooking show? And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it! I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.

Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? So, how 'bout them Knicks? No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! You're going back for the Countess, aren't you?

Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say. Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! That's not soon enough!

For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Leela's gonna kill me. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!

Bender, you risked your life to save me! Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?

Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very… Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it?

Is that a cooking show? Tell them I hate them. That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. You know, I was God once.

I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems.

Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Really?! Throw her in the brig.

Okay, okay you guys, oh ha ha ha very funny. Hey you guys are being real mature. Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly? And where's my reports? Where were we. Okay.

Oh. No, fine, no , good, fine, good. Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine. Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. you must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand? Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother.

Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense. Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works. Yeah. Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen. Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out, you could show me around.

Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall. But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. What, what, ma? My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one.

Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch. Why is she gonna get angry with you? A colored mayor, that'll be the day. C'mon, c'mon let's go.
